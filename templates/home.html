        <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>

        <p>I live in London and currently work in finance. But since buying my first Raspberry Pi a few 
             years ago, all I've wanted to do is code. I've mainly been learning Python, but I've picked up 
            lots of other <a href="{{ url_for ('skills')}}">skills</a> along the way. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I want to turn my hobby into a career. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So if you're looking for someone smart, hard working and eager to keep learning, 
            please get in <a href="mailto:edmilestech@gmail.com">contact</a>.
        </p>
