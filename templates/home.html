    <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>

    <p>I live in London and currently work in finance. But since buying my first Raspberry Pi a few 
         years ago, all I've wanted to do is code. I've mainly been learning Python, but I've picked up 
        lots of other <a href="{{ url_for ('skills')}}">skills</a> along the way. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Now I want to turn my hobby into a career. So if you're looking for someone smart, hard working and eager to keep learning, 
        please get in <a href="mailto:ed100miles@gmail.com">contact</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're interested in seeing what I can do, why not check out my <a href="{{ url_for ('scrabbler')}}">project.</a> 
        The video below gives you a sneak peak at what it does, and you can find the source code on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ed100miles/Portfolio">github</a>.
